Welcome to the Non-human Intelligence (NHI) Guidebook.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is a hobby project in response to the overwhelming amount of evidence and content available online.
        As I find myself keeping up with recent major developments and disclosures, I realized that a "guidebook", a way to navigate the massive landscape of discussions surrounding the topic, could be of great use for me and for others.
        <br>
        <br>
        My aim is to provide an all-encompassing approach of listing content across the different media types:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Podcasts:</strong> Likely the most common and far reaching medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Congressional Hearings:</strong> Recent hearings that have been monumental in the disclosure of major programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Close Encounters:</strong> The first, second, and <i>third</i> kind.</li>
            <li><strong>Books:</strong> Books that are commonly referenced.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentaries:</strong> Non-fiction films documenting knowledge we have so far.</li>
            <li><strong>Movies:</strong> Fictional films that might not be so fictional after all.</li>
            <li><strong>Games:</strong> Games that spark your imagination.</li>
        </ul>
